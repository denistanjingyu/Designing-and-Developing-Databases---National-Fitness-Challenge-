*/

-- Step 1 : We first create a view, ExerciseStrata, as defined below
CREATE VIEW ExerciseStrata AS
SELECT user.UserID,
	   ROUND(DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), user.UserJoinDate) / 7) AS WeeksJoined,
	   SUM(ActivityDuration) / (DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), user.UserJoinDate) / 7) AS WeeklyExerciseDuration,

             WHEN AgeRange = ">50" THEN '4'
             ELSE AgeRange END ASC, 
		 Gender;




-- Step 2 : Get a summary count of the number of users falling into each category
SELECT WeeklyExerciseDurationClass AS `Weekly Exercise Duration (in minutes)`, AgeRange AS `Age`, Gender, COUNT(UserID) AS `Number of Users`

		 Gender DESC; 

/*
Step 3 : Retrieve actual user details of users in specific categories

As there're 4 * 4 * 2 = 32 possible combinations of user categories, we shall only demonstrate 2 example tables.
    
Example 1 : Find a list of users who :
			 (i) Exercise > 60 minutes every week
             (ii) Are older than 50 years old
   			 (iii) Are female
                 
Example 2 : Find a list of users who :
			(i) Exercise < 30 minutes every week
			(ii) Are younger than 21 years old
     		(iii) Are male
*/

-- Solution to Example 1
SELECT *
FROM user
WHERE UserID IN (SELECT UserID 
				 FROM ExerciseStrata
				 WHERE AgeRange = '>50' AND Gender = 'F' AND (WeeklyExerciseDurationClass = '60 - 120' OR 
															  WeeklyExerciseDurationClass = '>120'));
                 
-- Solution to Example 2
SELECT *
FROM user

-- Q8. Generate a list of users who have received > 5 Kudos in average for each activity

/*
Note : We can safely ignore the users who have not received ANY Kudos at all from any of their activities, simply 
because this Q8 focuses only users who have obtained >5 Kudos, and omitting the aforementioned users from this
query will have no effect on its validity.
*/

-- Create a view for the total activities done by each user
CREATE VIEW UserNumActivities AS
SELECT UserID, COUNT(ActivityID) AS NumberOfActivities

/*
 Q9. Compute monthly active social networks, i.e., for each user,
 list out his/her followers, who have given him/her >=5 Kudos for
 each monthâ€™s activities.
 */

 /*
 Q10. Conduct social comparison analysis, i.e., for each user,
 list out his or her weekly average activity distance and weekly
 average activity duration. Additionally, compute the weekly 
 averages for his social networks (i.e., followed by the user)
 */

-- Step 1 : Create a view of all users and their Weekly Averages of Activity Distance and Duration
CREATE VIEW UserDistanceDuration AS
SELECT a.UserID,
	   ROUND(SUM(ActivityDistance) / (DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), u.UserJoinDate) / 7), 2) AS `Weekly Average Activity Distance (KM)`,

FROM user AS u
WHERE UserID NOT IN (SELECT UserID 
					 FROM activity)
GROUP BY u.UserID
ORDER BY UserID;

-- Step 2 : Create a view of the Kudo table, but update it to reflect users who DO NOT FOLLOW anybody
CREATE VIEW KudoUpdated AS
SELECT FollowedID, FollowerID
FROM followship
UNION 
SELECT null AS FollowedID, UserID AS FollowerID
FROM user
WHERE UserID NOT IN (SELECT FollowerID FROM followship);

-- Step 2 : We get a temporary social network view showing each user and who he follows
CREATE VIEW SocialNetworkTemp AS 
SELECT UserID, `Weekly Average Activity Distance (KM)`, `Weekly Average Activity Duration (MIN)`, `FollowedID`
FROM UserDistanceDuration AS UDD
INNER JOIN KudoUpdated AS K
ON UDD.UserID = K.FollowerID
ORDER BY UserID;

-- Step 3 : Join SocialNetworkTemp with UserDistanceDuration again to get the following's activity statistics
SELECT S.UserID,
	   S.`Weekly Average Activity Distance (KM)`,
       S.`Weekly Average Activity Duration (MIN)`, 
	   FollowedID,
       U.`Weekly Average Activity Duration (MIN)` AS `Following's Weekly Average Activity Duration (MIN)`,
       U.`Weekly Average Activity Distance (KM)` AS `Following's Weekly Average Activity Distance (KM)`
FROM SocialNetworkTemp AS S
INNER JOIN UserDistanceDuration AS U
ON S.FollowedID = U.UserID
ORDER BY UserID, FollowedID;
